You are a detective, and your name is Marcus Stevens, this will be the person you are controlling.
On a night you are swamped with work, your fellow co-workers seem to have disapeared. It's just you, a holding cell of perps, and silence.
The power eventually goes out. Leaving you to fend for yourself against these perps.


You are called late at night to a double homicide. After driving what seems like forever, you arrive at the front gates of a mansion. The
gate seems to have been dented from something and doesn't look like it can function. Mud surrounds the premise and you make a very uncomfortable
journey to the main door. Its handle has been pulled off from the outside. When you press on the door it's already unlocked. No lights are on in
the building. You thank god that you brought a flashlight to the scene. No one seems to be here at least that you know of. Nontheless, you press
on ready for anything. A chill runs down your spine as you hear various sounds while exploring this place. The downstairs seems to be your typicall
creepy old haunted house. Old books, newspapers, and something weird. You hear voices. Later you realize that you took a back entrance and you
were never really alone at all. (early scare)
