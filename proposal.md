# Major Project Proposal

## Description

I am going to create a detective text horror game. This will have some visuals but will mostly contain sounds.

## Must Have List

- Add a pause function
- Add a menu screen
- Add music (retro  and creepy style, I'll make this on my own time)
- Gravity
- create characters to talk to you
- add sounds and effects when certain descicions are made

## Nice To Have


- Add animations for characters
- Intro to the game
- Add advanced sound stuff (if there needs to be any imporovement)
