# Major Project Proposal

## Description

I am going to code a game inspired from Dig Doug and Motherload.

## Must Have List

- Add a pause function
- Add a menu screen
- Add music (retro style, I'll make this on my own time)
- Gravity
- Levels keeping the changes you've made in the evironment off screen
- A working money and upgrade system
- Creating a bad guy class that spawn in caves

## Nice To Have

- A camera to follow the player (to make map creation easier for me)
- Create gravity for various blocks
- Add water
- Add animations for digging and moving
- Intro to the game
